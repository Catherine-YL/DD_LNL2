# Dataset Distillers Are Good Label Denoisers In the Wild

## Getting Started

### Environment

You can create environment as follows

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ddlnl
```

### Dataset

For Tiny-ImageNet, it is best to download it yourself and then process it through `dataSolu/deal_Tiny.py`.

## Train

See `ddlnl_scripts.md` to reproduce the results
